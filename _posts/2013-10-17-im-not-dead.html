This is just to let you also know I am not dead. Rather merely running out of free time. So here is a list of things Ive been up to and will write about in the near future.<br /><br />- Analog to digital Conversions<br />- Pulse Width Modulation<br />- Assembly Language<br />- Verlilog Language<br />- Gate Logic<br />- Opamps (probably soon due to an exam)<br />- LaTex ( Soon because it is soooooo helpful for technical writing)<br />- Some secret stuuf I cant mention until it is published.<br />- Building custom Android ROM's<br /><br />and<br /><br />- pi2go is getting some cool GPS tracking and touchscreen features <br /><br />Until then, if you want to hear about any of these topics let me know!
