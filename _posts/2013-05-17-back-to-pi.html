Well I was going to brief you on the the results of Halo but I only had it going for a few hours.....but I really missed my AOKP features so went back to PACman. Ill go into more details later.<br /><br />This Post is all about the Raspberry Pi. I had a new project idea; I wanted a working computer in my '00 mustang. All the new fancy cars have soooo why cant mine. <br /><br />Needless to say I started working here is a preview picture (subject to change)<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-s6fOaONk3CY/UZbQBCJ3cvI/AAAAAAAAENE/W-VTsJfSqNU/s1600/pi2go.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="228" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-s6fOaONk3CY/UZbQBCJ3cvI/AAAAAAAAENE/W-VTsJfSqNU/s320/pi2go.png" width="320" /></a></div>The big blank spot will be some sort of logo. The current plan is to have full music playback and mechanical features (lights, controls, etc...)<br /><br />Let me know what you think, or even cool features.<br /><br />**For those that care written in python 2.7 w/ QT4 utilizing pyuic4<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Check out the code https://github.com/kd8bny/pi2go
